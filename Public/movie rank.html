        <h1> The best Movie According to Prajwal</h1>
        <h2> My top 3 Movies of all-Time.</h2>
        <Hr>
            <h3>Cars</h3>
            <p>This is one of the Disney's Classics And i have been a fan of this moive since my childhood. <br> I love the way the protagnist is discribed and how he overcomes all the difficult situations while learning a lot of stuff.</p>
            <h3>FNF: Tokyo Drift</h3>
            <p>This is part of that movie series that has its fair share of haters, but i am fan of this specific part for one sole reason and its how realistic and focused this movie was displaying the cultures of Japan Tokyo but aslo as a car enthusiast its a dream come true.</p>
            <h3>The Iron Man Series</h3>
            <p>I will be very honest that marvel has introducted a lot bangers over the years but this masterpiece can never be replaced from the top spot. The action, the comedy, the drama and all physics and science stuff make me fall in love with this movie</p>
